# Local Testing
If you'd like to run tests locally to verify the functionality of the application, follow these steps:

1. Install Test Dependencies
Ensure that the required testing dependencies are installed. If not already done, install them using:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run All Tests Using Pytest
From the root directory of the project, execute:
```bash
pytest -v
```

This will automatically discover and run all test cases located in the /tests directory.
